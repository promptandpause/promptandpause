## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Error: "API key not valid"
- Check you copied the entire key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)
- Make sure there are no spaces or line breaks
- Verify it's saved in `.env.local`
- Restart your dev server: `npm run dev`

### Error: "403 Forbidden" or "401 Unauthorized"
- Your API key may be restricted to specific IPs
- Go back to Google AI Studio → Click your key → "Unrestricted" or add your IP
- Make sure API is enabled for your project

### Not seeing "Generated with Gemini" in logs?
```bash
# Check your .env.local has:
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...  # Your actual key

# Restart your server:
npm run dev
```

### "Quota exceeded"
- You hit the 1,500/day limit (unlikely!)
- Wait until midnight UTC for reset
- Or upgrade to paid tier (still very cheap)

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit** `.env.local` to GitHub
2. **Keep your key secret** - it's like a password
3. **Regenerate key** if accidentally exposed:
   - Go to Google AI Studio
   - Delete old key
   - Create new key
   - Update `.env.local`
