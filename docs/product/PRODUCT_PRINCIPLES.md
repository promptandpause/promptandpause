# Product Principles

If a proposed change conflicts with these principles, the change should not ship unless there is clear user harm being addressed.

## What this product is

Prompt & Pause is a reflection practice.

The dashboard should feel like a calm morning desk: a place to arrive, write, and leave.

## What we optimize for

- Psychological safety and emotional neutrality
- Calm clarity over density
- “Available, not demanding” reflection
- Trust and long-term usefulness
- Honest churn (people leave when they don’t need it; they return when they do)

## What we do not optimize for

- Daily active usage as a primary goal
- Retention via guilt, pressure, or emotional nudging
- Engagement mechanics disguised as “support”

## The freeze line (non-negotiables)

### Do not add

- Progress meters
- Weekly/monthly scores
- Sentiment percentages
- Trend arrows
- “You’ve reflected X% more”
- “You’re more consistent than…”
- Notifications tied to insights
- Social features, reactions, or sharing

### Do not reintroduce

- Achievements
- Celebrations
- Streak pressure copy
- “Keep it up!” language

## Dashboard behavior principles

- Today is primary: a single prompt and a place to write.
- Weekly and monthly reflections are calm and collapsed by default.
- Insights reveal only when invited (explicit user action).
- “From Your Past” is rare, optional, dismissible, and must remain emotionally non-coercive.
- History is for retrieval, not judgment.
- Settings belong out of the emotional flow.

## Premium value principles

Premium should not be justified through analytics density.

Premium provides:

- Time-based perspective (weekly/monthly reflections)
- Memory (From Your Past)
- Retrieval (export, archive/search)

## Decision standard

When proposing a change, explicitly answer:

- What user harm does this prevent?
- What friction does this remove?
- How does it preserve psychological safety?

If a change cannot answer these, it should not ship.
